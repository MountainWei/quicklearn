Algorithms: a module of useful algorithms for Python
====================================================

This is an attempt to build a cohesive module of algorithms for Python.

The purpose of this repo is to be a learning tool for myself and others.

I used psuedo code from various sources and I have listed them as references in the source code of each algorithm.

Algorithms implemented so far:
------------------------------

**Sorting:**
    - Bubble Sort
    - Comb Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quick Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Shell Sort
    - Bogo Sort

**Searching:**
    - Binary Search
    - Knuth-Morris-Pratt

**Shuffling:**
    - Knuth/Fisher-Yates Shuffle

Installation:
-------------

Requirements are listed in :code:`requirements.txt`.

If you are using pip and virtualenv you can simply do:

.. code::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

To clone the repository simply:

.. code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/MountainWei/quicklearn.git

in to your working directory.

Usage:
------

Once cloned you can simply do the following in your program:

.. code:: python

    from algorithms.sorting import bubble_sort

    my_list = bubble_sort.sort(my_list)

All prequisites for the algorithms are listed in the source code for each algorithm.

Tests:
------------------------

Nose is used as the main test runner and all Unit Tests can be run by:

.. code::

    $ python algorithms/run_tests.py

TODO:
-----

Below is an ever changing list of things that I would like to accomplish or implement. If you feel something needs to be added simply do a pull request.

**Algorithms to implement:**
    - Rabin-Karp
    - Mersenne Twister
    - UUID Generator
    - Bloom Filters

**Misc.:**
    - Performance Tests
